# Adeo Nodejs Challenge

## Context

The goal is to develop a small command line in nodejs compound of two commands:

* filter: filter [animals](data.json) with their names
* count: count [country](data.json) and [people](data.json) childrens in their 'name' property

The code should be readable, well-structured, consistent, well-tested and should not use any libraries except for testing/linting.

## Getting Started

Commands usage:

* filter: `node src/main.js --filter=Wi`
* count: `node src/main.js --count`
* both: `node src/main.js --filter=Wi --count`

You can run the tests with the following command: `npm test`
